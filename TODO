NOTE:
	TODOs are divided in three parts: TO-BE-DONE, DONE and DONE-RECHECK.
	When a TODO has been completed must be moved to DONE or DONE-RECHECK
	if needs further checking. In DONE and DONE-RECHECK a date or a
	release version (the same that the ChangeLog shows) number should be
	added too (in order to remember when that TODO has been declared
	completed ...

TO-BE-DONE:
* Add -Wall -Werror options (like gcc)

* Start a dialog-oriented (dialog-wrapper) to combine with choose.sh script;
  obviously the `dialog' utility has to be installed on the system, however 
  the package will give a simple text-based configuration.
  [ALESSANDRO]

* Add a dialog-wrapper in order to interface choose.sh to dialog executable.

* Fix configure.ac in order to remove the crappy afbindir thing ...

DONE:
0.0.232:
* Fix the nastyness of autogen enclosed in src/Makefile.am (truly ugly)

* Find a way to handle different kinds of options in src/templates/options.tpl

* Fix tools/bootstrap.sh, tools/autotools/perl-depmod and
  tools/autotools/python-depmod files

* Invoke 'grep -r -i autosite' in the whole package, may i have left autosite
  traces somewhere

DONE-RECHECK:

* Remove from configure.ac all the unneeded things
