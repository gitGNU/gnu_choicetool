NOTE:
	TODOs are divided in three parts: TO-BE-DONE, DONE and DONE-RECHECK.
	When a TODO has been completed must be moved to DONE or DONE-RECHECK
	if needs further checking. In DONE and DONE-RECHECK a date or a
	release version (the same that the ChangeLog shows) number should be
	added too (in order to remember when that TODO has been declared
	completed ...

TO-BE-DONE:
* Parse.yp: Rearrange the parser in order to speed-up big files parsing

* Do a general clean-up of CHOICETOOL_BINARY_PATH, CHOICETOOL_DATA_PATH and
  CHOICETOOL_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables

* Handle multiple configuration syntaxes, translating them into a common
  configuration syntax; this deserves an option switch both on choicetool,
  choicetool-preprocess and choicetool-parse

* Check all string-related assert

DONE:
* Add sub-options handling in Options.pm module

* Rearrange the test-suite in order to avoid tests that require tools not
  installed on the host (e.g.: autotools)

* Add code into the libs/perl/Choicetool/Options.pm module in order to have a
  cleaner option parsing method


DONE-RECHECK:
