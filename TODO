NOTE:
	TODOs are divided in three parts: TO-BE-DONE, DONE and DONE-RECHECK.
	When a TODO item has been completed it should be moved to DONE or
	DONE-RECHECK, if it needs further checking.
	In DONE and DONE-RECHECK status a date or a release version tag should
	be added too.

TO-BE-DONE:
* libs/perl/Choicetool/Frontends/KConfig/Parse.yp: remove global variables
  ASAP

* UI/m4ify: Rearrange the output production, pass a stream instead of
  collecting strings in a stack-based approach

* Parse.yp: Rearrange the parser in order to speed-up big files parsing

* Do a general clean-up of CHOICETOOL_BINARY_PATH, CHOICETOOL_DATA_PATH and
  CHOICETOOL_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables

* Handle multiple configuration syntaxes, translating them into a common
  configuration syntax; this deserves an option switch both on choicetool,
  choicetool-preprocess and choicetool-parse

* Check all string-related assert

DONE:
* Add sub-options handling in Options.pm module

* Rearrange the test-suite in order to avoid tests that require tools not
  installed on the host (e.g.: autotools)

* Add code into the libs/perl/Choicetool/Options.pm module in order to have a
  cleaner option parsing method


DONE-RECHECK:
