config EXPERIMENTAL
	bool "Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers"
	---help---
	  Some of the various things that Linux supports (such as network
	  drivers, file systems, network protocols, etc.) can be in a state
	  of development where the functionality, stability, or the level of
	  testing is not yet high enough for general use. This is usually
	  known as the "alpha-test" phase among developers. If a feature is
	  currently in alpha-test, then the developers usually discourage
	  uninformed widespread use of this feature by the general public to
	  avoid "Why doesn't this work?" type mail messages. However, active
	  testing and use of these systems is welcomed. Just be aware that it
	  may not meet the normal level of reliability or it may fail to work
	  in some special cases. Detailed bug reports from people familiar
	  with the kernel internals are usually welcomed by the developers
	  (before submitting bug reports, please read the documents
	  <file:README>, <file:MAINTAINERS>, <file:REPORTING-BUGS>,
	  <file:Documentation/BUG-HUNTING>, and
	  <file:Documentation/oops-tracing.txt> in the kernel source).

	  This option will also make obsoleted drivers available. These are
	  drivers that have been replaced by something else, and/or are
	  scheduled to be removed in a future kernel release.

	  Unless you intend to help test and develop a feature or driver that
	  falls into this category, or you have a situation that requires
	  using these features, you should probably say N here, which will
	  cause the configurator to present you with fewer choices. If
	  you say Y here, you will be offered the choice of using features or
	  drivers that are currently considered to be in the alpha-test phase.

config LOCALVERSION
	string "Local version - append to kernel release"
	help
	  Append an extra string to the end of your kernel version.
	  This will show up when you type uname, for example.
	  The string you set here will be appended after the contents of
	  any files with a filename matching localversion* in your
	  object and source tree, in that order.  Your total string can
	  be a maximum of 64 characters.

config LOCALVERSION_AUTO
	bool "Automatically append version information to the version string"
	default y
	help
	  This will try to automatically determine if the current tree is a
	  release tree by looking for git tags that belong to the current
	  top of tree revision.

	  A string of the format -gxxxxxxxx will be added to the localversion
	  if a git-based tree is found.  The string generated by this will be
	  appended after any matching localversion* files, and after the value
	  set in CONFIG_LOCALVERSION.

	  (The actual string used here is the first eight characters produced
	  by running the command:

	    $ git rev-parse --verify HEAD

	  which is done within the script "scripts/setlocalversion".)

config SWAP
	bool "Support for paging of anonymous memory (swap)"
	depends on MMU && BLOCK
	default y
	help
	  This option allows you to choose whether you want to have support
	  for so called swap devices or swap files in your kernel that are
	  used to provide more virtual memory than the actual RAM present
	  in your computer.  If unsure say Y.

config SYSVIPC
	bool "System V IPC"
	---help---
	  Inter Process Communication is a suite of library functions and
	  system calls which let processes (running programs) synchronize and
	  exchange information. It is generally considered to be a good thing,
	  and some programs won't run unless you say Y here. In particular, if
	  you want to run the DOS emulator dosemu under Linux (read the
	  DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>),
	  you'll need to say Y here.

	  You can find documentation about IPC with "info ipc" and also in
	  section 6.4 of the Linux Programmer's Guide, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/guides.html>.

config IPC_NS
	bool "IPC Namespaces"
	depends on SYSVIPC
	default n
	help
	  Support ipc namespaces.  This allows containers, i.e. virtual
	  environments, to use ipc namespaces to provide different ipc
	  objects for different servers.  If unsure, say N.

config SYSVIPC_SYSCTL
	bool
	depends on SYSVIPC
	depends on SYSCTL
	default y

config POSIX_MQUEUE
	bool "POSIX Message Queues"
	depends on NET && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  POSIX variant of message queues is a part of IPC. In POSIX message
	  queues every message has a priority which decides about succession
	  of receiving it by a process. If you want to compile and run
	  programs written e.g. for Solaris with use of its POSIX message
	  queues (functions mq_*) say Y here.

	  POSIX message queues are visible as a filesystem called 'mqueue'
	  and can be mounted somewhere if you want to do filesystem
	  operations on message queues.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config BSD_PROCESS_ACCT
	bool "BSD Process Accounting"
	help
	  If you say Y here, a user level program will be able to instruct the
	  kernel (via a special system call) to write process accounting
	  information to a file: whenever a process exits, information about
	  that process will be appended to the file by the kernel.  The
	  information includes things such as creation time, owning user,
	  command name, memory usage, controlling terminal etc. (the complete
	  list is in the struct acct in <file:include/linux/acct.h>).  It is
	  up to the user level program to do useful things with this
	  information.  This is generally a good idea, so say Y.

config BSD_PROCESS_ACCT_V3
	bool "BSD Process Accounting version 3 file format"
	depends on BSD_PROCESS_ACCT
	default n
	help
	  If you say Y here, the process accounting information is written
	  in a new file format that also logs the process IDs of each
	  process and it's parent. Note that this file format is incompatible
	  with previous v0/v1/v2 file formats, so you will need updated tools
	  for processing it. A preliminary version of these tools is available
	  at <http://www.physik3.uni-rostock.de/tim/kernel/utils/acct/>.

config TASKSTATS
	bool "Export task/process statistics through netlink (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on NET
	default n
	help
	  Export selected statistics for tasks/processes through the
	  generic netlink interface. Unlike BSD process accounting, the
	  statistics are available during the lifetime of tasks/processes as
	  responses to commands. Like BSD accounting, they are sent to user
	  space on task exit.

	  Say N if unsure.

config TASK_DELAY_ACCT
	bool "Enable per-task delay accounting (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on TASKSTATS
	help
	  Collect information on time spent by a task waiting for system
	  resources like cpu, synchronous block I/O completion and swapping
	  in pages. Such statistics can help in setting a task's priorities
	  relative to other tasks for cpu, io, rss limits etc.

	  Say N if unsure.

config TASK_XACCT
	bool "Enable extended accounting over taskstats (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on TASKSTATS
	help
	  Collect extended task accounting data and send the data
	  to userland for processing over the taskstats interface.

	  Say N if unsure.

config TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING
	bool "Enable per-task storage I/O accounting (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on TASK_XACCT
	help
	  Collect information on the number of bytes of storage I/O which this
	  task has caused.

	  Say N if unsure.

config UTS_NS
	bool "UTS Namespaces"
	default n
	help
	  Support uts namespaces.  This allows containers, i.e.
	  vservers, to use uts namespaces to provide different
	  uts info for different servers.  If unsure, say N.

config AUDIT
	bool "Auditing support"
	depends on NET
	help
	  Enable auditing infrastructure that can be used with another
	  kernel subsystem, such as SELinux (which requires this for
	  logging of avc messages output).  Does not do system-call
	  auditing without CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL.

config AUDITSYSCALL
	bool "Enable system-call auditing support"
	depends on AUDIT && (X86 || PPC || PPC64 || S390 || IA64 || UML || SPARC64)
	default y if SECURITY_SELINUX
	help
	  Enable low-overhead system-call auditing infrastructure that
	  can be used independently or with another kernel subsystem,
	  such as SELinux.  To use audit's filesystem watch feature, please
	  ensure that INOTIFY is configured.

config IKCONFIG
	tristate "Kernel .config support"
	---help---
	  This option enables the complete Linux kernel ".config" file
	  contents to be saved in the kernel. It provides documentation
	  of which kernel options are used in a running kernel or in an
	  on-disk kernel.  This information can be extracted from the kernel
	  image file with the script scripts/extract-ikconfig and used as
	  input to rebuild the current kernel or to build another kernel.
	  It can also be extracted from a running kernel by reading
	  /proc/config.gz if enabled (below).

config IKCONFIG_PROC
	bool "Enable access to .config through /proc/config.gz"
	depends on IKCONFIG && PROC_FS
	---help---
	  This option enables access to the kernel configuration file
	  through /proc/config.gz.

config LOG_BUF_SHIFT
	int "Kernel log buffer size (16 => 64KB, 17 => 128KB)"
	range 12 21
	default 17 if S390 || LOCKDEP
	default 16 if X86_NUMAQ || IA64
	default 15 if SMP
	default 14
	help
	  Select kernel log buffer size as a power of 2.
	  Defaults and Examples:
	  	     17 => 128 KB for S/390
		     16 => 64 KB for x86 NUMAQ or IA-64
	             15 => 32 KB for SMP
	             14 => 16 KB for uniprocessor
		     13 =>  8 KB
		     12 =>  4 KB

config CPUSETS
	bool "Cpuset support"
	depends on SMP
	help
	  This option will let you create and manage CPUSETs which
	  allow dynamically partitioning a system into sets of CPUs and
	  Memory Nodes and assigning tasks to run only within those sets.
	  This is primarily useful on large SMP or NUMA systems.

	  Say N if unsure.

config SYSFS_DEPRECATED
	bool "Create deprecated sysfs files"
	default y
	help
	  This option creates deprecated symlinks such as the
	  "device"-link, the <subsystem>:<name>-link, and the
	  "bus"-link. It may also add deprecated key in the
	  uevent environment.
	  None of these features or values should be used today, as
	  they export driver core implementation details to userspace
	  or export properties which can't be kept stable across kernel
	  releases.

	  If enabled, this option will also move any device structures
	  that belong to a class, back into the /sys/class hierarchy, in
	  order to support older versions of udev.

	  If you are using a distro that was released in 2006 or later,
	  it should be safe to say N here.

config RELAY
	bool "Kernel->user space relay support (formerly relayfs)"
	help
	  This option enables support for relay interface support in
	  certain file systems (such as debugfs).
	  It is designed to provide an efficient mechanism for tools and
	  facilities to relay large amounts of data from kernel space to
	  user space.

	  If unsure, say N.

config BLK_DEV_INITRD
	bool "Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support"
	depends on BROKEN || !FRV
	help
	  The initial RAM filesystem is a ramfs which is loaded by the
	  boot loader (loadlin or lilo) and that is mounted as root
	  before the normal boot procedure. It is typically used to
	  load modules needed to mount the "real" root file system,
	  etc. See <file:Documentation/initrd.txt> for details.

	  If RAM disk support (BLK_DEV_RAM) is also included, this
	  also enables initial RAM disk (initrd) support and adds
	  15 Kbytes (more on some other architectures) to the kernel size.

	  If unsure say Y.

	  This can be either a single cpio archive with a .cpio suffix or a
	  space-separated list of directories and files for building the
	  initramfs image.  A cpio archive should contain a filesystem archive
	  to be used as an initramfs image.  Directories should contain a
	  filesystem layout to be included in the initramfs image.  Files
	  should contain entries according to the format described by the
	  "usr/gen_init_cpio" program in the kernel tree.

	  When multiple directories and files are specified then the
	  initramfs image will be the aggregate of all of them.

	  See <file:Documentation/early-userspace/README> for more details.

	  If you are not sure, leave it blank.

config INITRAMFS_ROOT_UID
	int "User ID to map to 0 (user root)"

	  using paths with ascii names is now the primary path to this
	  information.

	  Almost nothing using the binary sysctl interface so if you are
	  trying to save some space it is probably safe to disable this,
	  making your kernel marginally smaller.

	   you wait for kallsyms to be fixed.


config HOTPLUG
	bool "Support for hot-pluggable devices" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	help
	  This option is provided for the case where no hotplug or uevent
	  capabilities is wanted by the kernel.  You should only consider
	  disabling this option for embedded systems that do not use modules, a
	  dynamic /dev tree, or dynamic device discovery.  Just say Y.

config PRINTK
	default y
	bool "Enable support for printk" if EMBEDDED
	help
	  This option enables normal printk support. Removing it
	  eliminates most of the message strings from the kernel image
	  and makes the kernel more or less silent. As this makes it
	  very difficult to diagnose system problems, saying N here is
	  strongly discouraged.

config BUG
	bool "BUG() support" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	help
          Disabling this option eliminates support for BUG and WARN, reducing
          the size of your kernel image and potentially quietly ignoring
          numerous fatal conditions. You should only consider disabling this
          option for embedded systems with no facilities for reporting errors.

	  The shmem is an internal filesystem used to manage shared memory.
	  It is backed by swap and manages resource limits. It is also exported
	  to userspace as tmpfs if TMPFS is enabled. Disabling this

	  permanently built into the kernel.  You use the "modprobe"
	  tool to add (and sometimes remove) them.  If you say Y here,
	  many parts of the kernel can be built as modules (by
	  answering M instead of Y where indicated): this is most
	  useful for infrequently used options which are not required
	  for booting.  For more information, see the man pages for
	  modprobe, lsmod, modinfo, insmod and rmmod.

	  If you say Y here, you will need to run "make
	  modules_install" to put the modules under /lib/modules/
	  where modprobe can find them (you may need to be root to do
	  this).

	  If unsure, say Y.

config MODULE_UNLOAD
	bool "Module unloading"
	depends on MODULES
	help
	  Without this option you will not be able to unload any
	  modules (note that some modules may not be unloadable
	  anyway), which makes your kernel slightly smaller and
	  simpler.  If unsure, say Y.

config MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD
	bool "Forced module unloading"
	depends on MODULE_UNLOAD && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This option allows you to force a module to unload, even if the
	  kernel believes it is unsafe: the kernel will remove the module
	  without waiting for anyone to stop using it (using the -f option to
	  rmmod).  This is mainly for kernel developers and desperate users.
	  If unsure, say N.

config MODVERSIONS
	bool "Module versioning support"
	depends on MODULES
	help
	  Usually, you have to use modules compiled with your kernel.
	  Saying Y here makes it sometimes possible to use modules
	  compiled for different kernels, by adding enough information
	  to the modules to (hopefully) spot any changes which would
	  make them incompatible with the kernel you are running.  If
	  unsure, say N.

config MODULE_SRCVERSION_ALL
	bool "Source checksum for all modules"
	depends on MODULES
	help
	  Modules which contain a MODULE_VERSION get an extra "srcversion"
	  field inserted into their modinfo section, which contains a
    	  sum of the source files which made it.  This helps maintainers
	  see exactly which source was used to build a module (since
	  others sometimes change the module source without updating
	  the version).  With this option, such a "srcversion" field
	  will be created for all modules.  If unsure, say N.

config KMOD
	bool "Automatic kernel module loading"
	depends on MODULES
	help
	  Normally when you have selected some parts of the kernel to
	  be created as kernel modules, you must load them (using the
	  "modprobe" command) before you can use them. If you say Y
	  here, some parts of the kernel will be able to load modules
	  automatically: when a part of the kernel needs a module, it
	  runs modprobe with the appropriate arguments, thereby
	  loading the module if it is available.  If unsure, say Y.

	  Linux can use up to 64 Gigabytes of physical memory on x86 systems.
	  However, the address space of 32-bit x86 processors is only 4
	  Gigabytes large. That means that, if you have a large amount of
	  physical memory, not all of it can be "permanently mapped" by the
	  kernel. The physical memory that's not permanently mapped is called
	  "high memory".

	  If you are compiling a kernel which will never run on a machine with
	  more than 1 Gigabyte total physical RAM, answer "off" here (default
	  choice and suitable for most users). This will result in a "3GB/1GB"
	  split: 3GB are mapped so that each process sees a 3GB virtual memory
	  space and the remaining part of the 4GB virtual memory space is used
	  by the kernel to permanently map as much physical memory as
	  possible.

	  If the machine has between 1 and 4 Gigabytes physical RAM, then
	  answer "4GB" here.

	  If more than 4 Gigabytes is used then answer "64GB" here. This
	  selection turns Intel PAE (Physical Address Extension) mode on.
	  PAE implements 3-level paging on IA32 processors. PAE is fully
	  supported by Linux, PAE mode is implemented on all recent Intel
	  processors (Pentium Pro and better). NOTE: If you say "64GB" here,
	  then the kernel will not boot on CPUs that don't support PAE!

	  The actual amount of total physical memory will either be
	  auto detected or can be forced by using a kernel command line option
	  such as "mem=256M". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of

config MATH_EMULATION
	bool "Math emulation"
	---help---
	  Linux can emulate a math coprocessor (used for floating point

	  a math coprocessor built in, 486SX and 386 do not, unless you added
	  a 487DX or 387, respectively. (The messages during boot time can
	  give you some hints here ["man dmesg"].) Everyone needs either a
	  coprocessor or this emulation.

	  If you don't have a math coprocessor, you need to say Y here; if you
	  say Y here even though you have a coprocessor, the coprocessor will
	  be used nevertheless. (This behavior can be changed with the kernel
	  command line option "no387", which comes handy if your coprocessor
	  is broken. Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot
	  loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at
	  boot time.) This means that it is a good idea to say Y here if you
	  intend to use this kernel on different machines.

	  More information about the internals of the Linux math coprocessor
	  emulation can be found in <file:arch/i386/math-emu/README>.

	  If you are not sure, say Y; apart from resulting in a 66 KB bigger
	  kernel, it won't hurt.

config MTRR
	bool "MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support"
	---help---
	  On Intel P6 family processors (Pentium Pro, Pentium II and later)
	  the Memory Type Range Registers (MTRRs) may be used to control
	  processor access to memory ranges. This is most useful if you have
	  a video (VGA) card on a PCI or AGP bus. Enabling write-combining
	  allows bus write transfers to be combined into a larger transfer
	  before bursting over the PCI/AGP bus. This can increase performance
	  of image write operations 2.5 times or more. Saying Y here creates a
	  /proc/mtrr file which may be used to manipulate your processor's
	  MTRRs. Typically the X server should use this.

	  This code has a reasonably generic interface so that similar
	  control registers on other processors can be easily supported
	  as well:

	  The Cyrix 6x86, 6x86MX and M II processors have Address Range
	  Registers (ARRs) which provide a similar functionality to MTRRs. For
	  these, the ARRs are used to emulate the MTRRs.
	  The AMD K6-2 (stepping 8 and above) and K6-3 processors have two
	  MTRRs. The Centaur C6 (WinChip) has 8 MCRs, allowing
	  write-combining. All of these processors are supported by this code
	  and it makes sense to say Y here if you have one of them.

	  Saying Y here also fixes a problem with buggy SMP BIOSes which only
	  set the MTRRs for the boot CPU and not for the secondary CPUs. This
	  can lead to all sorts of problems, so it's good to say Y here.

	  You can safely say Y even if your machine doesn't have MTRRs, you'll
	  just add about 9 KB to your kernel.

	  See <file:Documentation/mtrr.txt> for more information.

	  defined by each seccomp mode.

	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
	  current kernel, and to start another kernel.  It is like a reboot
	  but it is independent of the system firmware.   And like a reboot
	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.

	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.

	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
	  initially work for you.  It may help to enable device hotplugging
	  support.  As of this writing the exact hardware interface is
	  strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be made.

config CRASH_DUMP
	bool "kernel crash dumps (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	depends on HIGHMEM
	help
	  Generate crash dump after being started by kexec.
          This should be normally only set in special crash dump kernels
	  which are loaded in the main kernel with kexec-tools into
	  a specially reserved region and then later executed after
	  a crash by kdump/kexec. The crash dump kernel must be compiled
          to a memory address not used by the main kernel or BIOS using
          PHYSICAL_START.
	  For more details see Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt

config PHYSICAL_START
	hex "Physical address where the kernel is loaded" if (EMBEDDED || CRASH_DUMP)
	default "0x100000"
	help
	  This gives the physical address where the kernel is loaded.

	  If kernel is a not relocatable (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=n) then
	  bzImage will decompress itself to above physical address and
	  run from there. Otherwise, bzImage will run from the address where
	  it has been loaded by the boot loader and will ignore above physical
	  address.

	  In normal kdump cases one does not have to set/change this option
	  as now bzImage can be compiled as a completely relocatable image
	  (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y) and be used to load and run from a different
	  address. This option is mainly useful for the folks who don't want
	  to use a bzImage for capturing the crash dump and want to use a
	  vmlinux instead. vmlinux is not relocatable hence a kernel needs
	  to be specifically compiled to run from a specific memory area
	  (normally a reserved region) and this option comes handy.

	  So if you are using bzImage for capturing the crash dump, leave
	  the value here unchanged to 0x100000 and set CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y.
	  Otherwise if you plan to use vmlinux for capturing the crash dump
	  change this value to start of the reserved region (Typically 16MB
	  0x1000000). In other words, it can be set based on the "X" value as
	  specified in the "crashkernel=YM@XM" command line boot parameter
	  passed to the panic-ed kernel. Typically this parameter is set as
	  crashkernel=64M@16M. Please take a look at
	  Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt for more details about crash dumps.

	  Usage of bzImage for capturing the crash dump is recommended as
	  one does not have to build two kernels. Same kernel can be used
	  as production kernel and capture kernel. Above option should have
	  gone away after relocatable bzImage support is introduced. But it
	  is present because there are users out there who continue to use
	  vmlinux for dump capture. This option should go away down the
	  line.

	  Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.

config RELOCATABLE
	bool "Build a relocatable kernel(EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This builds a kernel image that retains relocation information
          so it can be loaded someplace besides the default 1MB.
	  The relocations tend to make the kernel binary about 10% larger,
          but are discarded at runtime.

	  One use is for the kexec on panic case where the recovery kernel
          must live at a different physical address than the primary
          kernel.

config PHYSICAL_ALIGN
	hex "Alignment value to which kernel should be aligned"
	default "0x100000"
	range 0x2000 0x400000
	help
	  This value puts the alignment restrictions on physical address
 	  where kernel is loaded and run from. Kernel is compiled for an
 	  address which meets above alignment restriction.

 	  If bootloader loads the kernel at a non-aligned address and
 	  CONFIG_RELOCATABLE is set, kernel will move itself to nearest
 	  address aligned to above value and run from there.

 	  If bootloader loads the kernel at a non-aligned address and
 	  CONFIG_RELOCATABLE is not set, kernel will ignore the run time
 	  load address and decompress itself to the address it has been
 	  compiled for and run from there. The address for which kernel is
 	  compiled already meets above alignment restrictions. Hence the
 	  end result is that kernel runs from a physical address meeting
	  above alignment restrictions.

	  Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.

	To use this debugging feature you should attempt to suspend the machine,
	then reboot it, then run

	---help---
	  Enable the suspend to disk (STD) functionality, which is usually
	  called "hibernation" in user interfaces.  STD checkpoints the
	  system and powers it off; and restores that checkpoint on reboot.

	  You can suspend your machine with 'echo disk > /sys/power/state'.
	  Alternatively, you can use the additional userland tools available
	  from <http://suspend.sf.net>.

	  In principle it does not require ACPI or APM, although for example
	  ACPI will be used for the final steps when it is available.  One
	  of the reasons to use software suspend is that the firmware hooks
	  for suspend states like suspend-to-RAM (STR) often don't work very
	  well with Linux.

	  It creates an image which is saved in your active swap. Upon the next
	  boot, pass the 'resume=/dev/swappartition' argument to the kernel to
	  have it detect the saved image, restore memory state from it, and
	  continue to run as before. If you do not want the previous state to
	  be reloaded, then use the 'noresume' kernel command line argument.
	  Note, however, that fsck will be run on your filesystems and you will
	  need to run mkswap against the swap partition used for the suspend.

	  It also works with swap files to a limited extent (for details see
	  <file:Documentation/power/swsusp-and-swap-files.txt>).

	  Right now you may boot without resuming and resume later but in the
	  meantime you cannot use the swap partition(s)/file(s) involved in
	  suspending.  Also in this case you must not use the filesystems
	  that were mounted before the suspend.  In particular, you MUST NOT
	  MOUNT any journaled filesystems mounted before the suspend or they
	  will get corrupted in a nasty way.

	  For more information take a look at <file:Documentation/power/swsusp.txt>.

	  This driver does not spin down disk drives (see the hdparm(8)

	  Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) support for

	  The ACPI SourceForge project contains the latest source code, 
	  documentation, tools, mailing list subscription, and other 
	  information.  This project is available at:
	  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/acpi>

	  Linux support for ACPI is based on Intel Corporation's ACPI
	  Component Architecture (ACPI CA).  For more information see:

menuconfig APM
	tristate "APM (Advanced Power Management) BIOS support"
	depends on PM && !X86_VISWS
	---help---
	  APM is a BIOS specification for saving power using several different
	  techniques. This is mostly useful for battery powered laptops with
	  APM compliant BIOSes. If you say Y here, the system time will be
	  reset after a RESUME operation, the /proc/apm device will provide
	  battery status information, and user-space programs will receive
	  notification of APM "events" (e.g. battery status change).

	  If you select "Y" here, you can disable actual use of the APM
	  BIOS by passing the "apm=off" option to the kernel at boot time.

	  Note that the APM support is almost completely disabled for
	  machines with more than one CPU.

	  In order to use APM, you will need supporting software. For location
	  and more information, read <file:Documentation/pm.txt> and the
	  Battery Powered Linux mini-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  This driver does not spin down disk drives (see the hdparm(8)
	  manpage ("man 8 hdparm") for that), and it doesn't turn off
	  VESA-compliant "green" monitors.

	  This driver does not support the TI 4000M TravelMate and the ACER
	  486/DX4/75 because they don't have compliant BIOSes. Many "green"
	  desktop machines also don't have compliant BIOSes, and this driver
	  may cause those machines to panic during the boot phase.

	  Generally, if you don't have a battery in your machine, there isn't
	  much point in using this driver and you should say N. If you get
	  random kernel OOPSes or reboots that don't seem to be related to
	  anything, try disabling/enabling this option (or disabling/enabling
	  APM in your BIOS).

	  Some other things you should try when experiencing seemingly random,
	  "weird" problems:

	  1) make sure that you have enough swap space and that it is
	  enabled.
	  2) pass the "no-hlt" option to the kernel
	  3) switch on floating point emulation in the kernel and pass
	  the "no387" option to the kernel
	  4) pass the "floppy=nodma" option to the kernel
	  5) pass the "mem=4M" option to the kernel (thereby disabling
	  all but the first 4 MB of RAM)
	  6) make sure that the CPU is not over clocked.
	  7) read the sig11 FAQ at <http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/>
	  8) disable the cache from your BIOS settings
	  9) install a fan for the video card or exchange video RAM
	  10) install a better fan for the CPU
	  11) exchange RAM chips
	  12) exchange the motherboard.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called apm.

config APM_DO_ENABLE
	bool "Enable PM at boot time"
	---help---
	  Enable APM features at boot time. From page 36 of the APM BIOS
	  specification: "When disabled, the APM BIOS does not automatically
	  power manage devices, enter the Standby State, enter the Suspend
	  State, or take power saving steps in response to CPU Idle calls."
	  This driver will make CPU Idle calls when Linux is idle (unless this
	  feature is turned off -- see "Do CPU IDLE calls", below). This
	  should always save battery power, but more complicated APM features
	  will be dependent on your BIOS implementation. You may need to turn
	  this option off if your computer hangs at boot time when using APM
	  support, or if it beeps continuously instead of suspending. Turn
	  this off if you have a NEC UltraLite Versa 33/C or a Toshiba
	  T400CDT. This is off by default since most machines do fine without

	  a slowed CPU clock rate, when the machine is idle. These idle calls
	  are made after the idle loop has run for some length of time (e.g.,
	  333 mS). On some machines, this will cause a hang at boot time or
	  whenever the CPU becomes idle. (On machines with more than one CPU,

	  the virtual console screen blanker, and won't turn off the backlight
	  when using the X Window system. This also doesn't have anything to
	  do with your VESA-compliant power-saving monitor. Further, this
	  option doesn't work for all laptops -- it might not turn off your
	  backlight at all, or it might print a lot of errors to the console,
	  especially if you are using gpm.

config APM_ALLOW_INTS
	bool "Allow interrupts during APM BIOS calls"
	help
	  Normally we disable external interrupts while we are making calls to

	  ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for libraries and

	  and enlarge it by about 13 KB. ELF support under Linux has now all
	  but replaced the traditional Linux a.out formats (QMAGIC and ZMAGIC)
	  because it is portable (this does *not* mean that you will be able
	  to run executables from different architectures or operating systems
	  however) and makes building run-time libraries very easy. Many new
	  executables are distributed solely in ELF format. You definitely
	  want to say Y here.

	  Information about ELF is contained in the ELF HOWTO available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If you find that after upgrading from Linux kernel 1.2 and saying Y
	  here, you still can't run any ELF binaries (they just crash), then

	  The conversion to ELF started in 1995.  This option is primarily

	  will automatically feed it to the correct interpreter.

	  You can do other nice things, too. Read the file

	  You may say M here for module support and later load the module when

	  so-called IP spoofing, however it can pose problems if you use
	  asymmetric routing (packets from you to a host take a different path
	  than packets from that host to you) or if you operate a non-routing
	  host which has several IP addresses on different interfaces. To turn

config ARPD

	  Normally, the kernel maintains an internal cache which maps IP

	  Ethernet/Token Ring/ etc. frames are sent to the proper address on
	  the physical networking layer. For small networks having a few
	  hundred directly connected hosts or less, keeping this address
	  resolution (ARP) cache inside the kernel works well. However,
	  maintaining an internal ARP cache does not work well for very large
	  switched networks, and will use a lot of kernel memory if TCP/IP
	  connections are made to many machines on the network.

	  If you say Y here, the kernel's internal ARP cache will never grow
	  to more than 256 entries (the oldest entries are expired in a LIFO
	  manner) and communication will be attempted with the user space ARP
	  daemon arpd. Arpd then answers the address resolution request either
	  from its own cache or by asking the net.

	  This code is experimental and also obsolete. If you want to use it,
	  you need to find a version of the daemon arpd on the net somewhere,

config SYN_COOKIES

	  Normal TCP/IP networking is open to an attack known as "SYN

	  users from being able to connect to your computer during an ongoing
	  attack and requires very little work from the attacker, who can
	  operate from anywhere on the Internet.

	  SYN cookies provide protection against this type of attack. If you
	  say Y here, the TCP/IP stack will use a cryptographic challenge
	  protocol known as "SYN cookies" to enable legitimate users to
	  continue to connect, even when your machine is under attack. There
	  is no need for the legitimate users to change their TCP/IP software;
	  SYN cookies work transparently to them. For technical information
	  about SYN cookies, check out <http://cr.yp.to/syncookies.html>.

	  If you are SYN flooded, the source address reported by the kernel is
	  likely to have been forged by the attacker; it is only reported as
	  an aid in tracing the packets to their actual source and should not
	  be taken as absolute truth.

	  SYN cookies may prevent correct error reporting on clients when the
	  server is really overloaded. If this happens frequently better turn
	  them off.

	  If you say Y here, note that SYN cookies aren't enabled by default;

menuconfig NETFILTER
	bool "Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter)"
	---help---
	  Netfilter is a framework for filtering and mangling network packets
	  that pass through your Linux box.

	  The most common use of packet filtering is to run your Linux box as
	  a firewall protecting a local network from the Internet. The type of
	  firewall provided by this kernel support is called a "packet
	  filter", which means that it can reject individual network packets
	  based on type, source, destination etc. The other kind of firewall,
	  a "proxy-based" one, is more secure but more intrusive and more
	  bothersome to set up; it inspects the network traffic much more
	  closely, modifies it and has knowledge about the higher level
	  protocols, which a packet filter lacks. Moreover, proxy-based
	  firewalls often require changes to the programs running on the local
	  clients. Proxy-based firewalls don't need support by the kernel, but
	  they are often combined with a packet filter, which only works if
	  you say Y here.

	  You should also say Y here if you intend to use your Linux box as
	  the gateway to the Internet for a local network of machines without
	  globally valid IP addresses. This is called "masquerading": if one
	  of the computers on your local network wants to send something to
	  the outside, your box can "masquerade" as that computer, i.e. it
	  forwards the traffic to the intended outside destination, but
	  modifies the packets to make it look like they came from the
	  firewall box itself. It works both ways: if the outside host
	  replies, the Linux box will silently forward the traffic to the
	  correct local computer. This way, the computers on your local net
	  are completely invisible to the outside world, even though they can
	  reach the outside and can receive replies. It is even possible to
	  run globally visible servers from within a masqueraded local network
	  using a mechanism called portforwarding. Masquerading is also often
	  called NAT (Network Address Translation).

	  Another use of Netfilter is in transparent proxying: if a machine on
	  the local network tries to connect to an outside host, your Linux
	  box can transparently forward the traffic to a local server,
	  typically a caching proxy server.

	  Yet another use of Netfilter is building a bridging firewall. Using
	  a bridge with Network packet filtering enabled makes iptables "see"
	  the bridged traffic. For filtering on the lower network and Ethernet
	  protocols over the bridge, use ebtables (under bridge netfilter
	  configuration).

	  Various modules exist for netfilter which replace the previous
	  masquerading (ipmasqadm), packet filtering (ipchains), transparent
	  proxying, and portforwarding mechanisms. Please see
	  <file:Documentation/Changes> under "iptables" for the location of
	  these packages.

	  Make sure to say N to "Fast switching" below if you intend to say Y
	  here, as Fast switching currently bypasses netfilter.

	  Chances are that you should say Y here if you compile a kernel which
	  will run as a router and N for regular hosts. If unsure, say N.

	  This option adds a `TCPMSS' target, which allows you to alter the
	  MSS value of TCP SYN packets, to control the maximum size for that
	  connection (usually limiting it to your outgoing interface's MTU
	  minus 40).

	  This is used to overcome criminally braindead ISPs or servers which
	  block ICMP Fragmentation Needed packets.  The symptoms of this
	  problem are that everything works fine from your Linux
	  firewall/router, but machines behind it can never exchange large
	  packets:
	        1) Web browsers connect, then hang with no data received.
	        2) Small mail works fine, but large emails hang.
	        3) ssh works fine, but scp hangs after initial handshaking.

	  Workaround: activate this option and add a rule to your firewall
	  configuration like:

	  iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN \

	    The TFRC nofeedback timer normally expires after the maximum of 4
	    RTTs and twice the current send interval (RFC 3448, 4.3). On LANs
	    with a small RTT this can mean a high processing load and reduced
	    performance, since then the nofeedback timer is triggered very
	    frequently.

	    This option enables to set a higher lower bound for the nofeedback
	    value. Values in units of milliseconds can be set here.

	    A value of 0 disables this feature by enforcing the value specified
	    in RFC 3448. The following values have been suggested as bounds for
	    experimental use:
	    	* 16-20ms to match the typical multimedia inter-frame interval
	    	* 100ms as a reasonable compromise [default]
	    	* 1000ms corresponds to the lower TCP RTO bound (RFC 2988, 2.4)

	    The default of 100ms is a compromise between a large value for
	    efficient DCCP implementations, and a small value to avoid disrupting
	    the network in times of congestion.

	    The purpose of the nofeedback timer is to slow DCCP down when there
	    is serious network congestion: experimenting with larger values should
	    therefore not be performed on WANs.

	  Every IPX network has an address that identifies it. Sometimes it is

	  (for example if your box is acting as a file server for different
	  IPX networks: it will then be accessible from everywhere using the
	  same address). The way this is done is to create a virtual internal
	  "network" inside your box and to assign an IPX address to this
	  network. Say Y here if you want to do this; read the IPX-HOWTO at
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto> for details.

	  The full internal IPX network enables you to allocate sockets on
	  different virtual nodes of the internal network. This is done by
	  evaluating the field sipx_node of the socket address given to the
	  bind call. So applications should always initialize the node field
	  to 0 when binding a socket on the primary network. In this case the
	  socket is assigned the default node that has been given to the
	  kernel when the internal network was created. By enabling the full
	  internal IPX network the cross-forwarding of packets targeted at
	  'special' sockets to sockets listening on the primary network is
	  disabled. This might break existing applications, especially RIP/SAP
	  daemons. A RIP/SAP daemon that works well with the full internal net
	  can be found on <ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/ncpfs/>.

	---help---
	  Wide Area Networks (WANs), such as X.25, frame relay and leased
	  lines, are used to interconnect Local Area Networks (LANs) over vast
	  distances with data transfer rates significantly higher than those
	  achievable with commonly used asynchronous modem connections.
	  Usually, a quite expensive external device called a `WAN router' is
	  needed to connect to a WAN.

	  As an alternative, WAN routing can be built into the Linux kernel.
	  With relatively inexpensive WAN interface cards available on the
	  market, a perfectly usable router can be built for less than half
	  the price of an external router.  If you have one of those cards and
	  wish to use your Linux box as a WAN router, say Y here and also to
	  the WAN driver for your card, below.  You will then need the
	  wan-tools package which is available from <ftp://ftp.sangoma.com/>.
	  Read <file:Documentation/networking/wan-router.txt> for more
	  information.

	  To compile WAN routing support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called wanrouter.

	---help---
	  When the kernel has several packets to send out over a network
	  device, it has to decide which ones to send first, which ones to
	  delay, and which ones to drop. This is the job of the queueing
	  disciplines, several different algorithms for how to do this
	  "fairly" have been proposed.

	  If you say N here, you will get the standard packet scheduler, which
	  is a FIFO (first come, first served). If you say Y here, you will be
	  able to choose from among several alternative algorithms which can
	  then be attached to different network devices. This is useful for
	  example if some of your network devices are real time devices that
	  need a certain minimum data flow rate, or if you need to limit the
	  maximum data flow rate for traffic which matches specified criteria.
	  This code is considered to be experimental.

	  To administer these schedulers, you'll need the user-level utilities
	  from the package iproute2+tc at <ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/net/ip-routing/>.
	  That package also contains some documentation; for more, check out
	  <http://linux-net.osdl.org/index.php/Iproute2>.

	  This Quality of Service (QoS) support will enable you to use
	  Differentiated Services (diffserv) and Resource Reservation Protocol
	  (RSVP) on your Linux router if you also say Y to the corresponding
	  classifiers below.  Documentation and software is at
	  <http://diffserv.sourceforge.net/>.

	  If you say Y here and to "/proc file system" below, you will be able
	  to read status information about packet schedulers from the file

	depends on AX25
	select CRC16
	---help---
	  KISS is a protocol used for the exchange of data between a computer
	  and a Terminal Node Controller (a small embedded system commonly
	  used for networking over AX.25 amateur radio connections; it
	  connects the computer's serial port with the radio's microphone
	  input and speaker output).

	  Although KISS is less advanced than the 6pack protocol, it has
	  the advantage that it is already supported by most modern TNCs
	  without the need for a firmware upgrade.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called mkiss.

config 6PACK
	tristate "Serial port 6PACK driver"
	depends on AX25
	---help---
	  6pack is a transmission protocol for the data exchange between your
	  PC and your TNC (the Terminal Node Controller acts as a kind of
	  modem connecting your computer's serial port to your radio's
	  microphone input and speaker output). This protocol can be used as
	  an alternative to KISS for networking over AX.25 amateur radio
	  connections, but it has some extended functionality.

	  Note that this driver is still experimental and might cause
	  problems. For details about the features and the usage of the
	  driver, read <file:Documentation/networking/6pack.txt>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called 6pack.

config BPQETHER

	help
	  AX.25 is the protocol used for computer communication over amateur
	  radio. If you say Y here, you will be able to send and receive AX.25
	  traffic over Ethernet (also called "BPQ AX.25"), which could be
	  useful if some other computer on your local network has a direct
	  amateur radio connection.

config DMASCC
	tristate "High-speed (DMA) SCC driver for AX.25"
	depends on ISA && AX25 && BROKEN_ON_SMP && ISA_DMA_API
	---help---
	  This is a driver for high-speed SCC boards, i.e. those supporting
	  DMA on one port. You usually use those boards to connect your
	  computer to an amateur radio modem (such as the WA4DSY 56kbps
	  modem), in order to send and receive AX.25 packet radio network
	  traffic.

	  Currently, this driver supports Ottawa PI/PI2, Paccomm/Gracilis
	  PackeTwin, and S5SCC/DMA boards. They are detected automatically.
	  If you have one of these cards, say Y here and read the AX25-HOWTO,
	  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  This driver can operate multiple boards simultaneously. If you
	  compile it as a module (by saying M instead of Y), it will be called
	  dmascc. If you don't pass any parameter to the driver, all
	  possible I/O addresses are probed. This could irritate other devices
	  that are currently not in use. You may specify the list of addresses
	  to be probed by "dmascc=addr1,addr2,..." (when compiled into the
	  kernel image) or "io=addr1,addr2,..." (when loaded as a module). The
	  network interfaces will be called dmascc0 and dmascc1 for the board
	  detected first, dmascc2 and dmascc3 for the second one, and so on.

	  Before you configure each interface with ifconfig, you MUST set
	  certain parameters, such as channel access timing, clock mode, and
	  DMA channel. This is accomplished with a small utility program,
	  dmascc_cfg, available at
	  <http://cacofonix.nt.tuwien.ac.at/~oe1kib/Linux/>. Please be sure to
	  get at least version 1.27 of dmascc_cfg, as older versions will not

	depends on IRDA
	---help---
	  Say Y here is you want IrLAP to send fast RR (Receive Ready) frames
	  when acting as a primary station.
	  Disabling this option will make latency over IrDA very bad. Enabling
	  this option will make the IrDA stack send more packet than strictly
	  necessary, thus reduce your battery life (but not that much).

	  Fast RR will make IrLAP send out a RR frame immediately when
	  receiving a frame if its own transmit queue is currently empty. This
	  will give a lot of speed improvement when receiving much data since
	  the secondary station will not have to wait the max. turn around
	  time (usually 500ms) before it is allowed to transmit the next time.
	  If the transmit queue of the secondary is also empty, the primary will
	  start backing-off before sending another RR frame, waiting longer
	  each time until the back-off reaches the max. turn around time.

	  You will still need the parsing functions to be called by the driver

	  Allow generic configuration of the MTD partition tables via the kernel
	  command line. Multiple flash resources are supported for hardware where
	  different kinds of flash memory are available.

	  You will still need the parsing functions to be called by the driver
	  for your particular device. It won't happen automatically. The
	  SA1100 map driver (CONFIG_MTD_SA1100) has an option for this, for
	  example.

	  The format for the command line is as follows:

	  mtdparts=<mtddef>[;<mtddef]
	  <mtddef>  := <mtd-id>:<partdef>[,<partdef>]
	  <partdef> := <size>[@offset][<name>][ro]

	  <size>    := standard linux memsize OR "-" to denote all
	  remaining space
	  <name>    := (NAME)

	  Due to the way Linux handles the command line, no spaces are
	  allowed in the partition definition, including mtd id's and partition
	  names.

	  Examples:

	  1 flash resource (mtd-id "sa1100"), with 1 single writable partition:
	  mtdparts=sa1100:-

	  Same flash, but 2 named partitions, the first one being read-only:

	  If this driver is compiled as a module you get the ability to select
	  the size of the aperture window pointing into the devices memory.
	  What this means is that if you have a 1G card, normally the kernel
	  will use a 1G memory map as its view of the device.  As a module,
	  you can select a 1M window into the memory and the driver will
	  "slide" the window around the PMC551's memory.  This was

	  Linux uses the PNPBIOS as defined in "Plug and Play BIOS

	  Writes to the virtual block device are not immediately written to the

	  Linux 'Virtual Machine' uses a journalling filesystem and the host
	  computer crashes.

          Synchronous operation (i.e. always writing data to the host's disk
          immediately) is configurable on a per-UBD basis by using a special
          kernel command line option.  Alternatively, you can say Y here to

config BLK_DEV_LOOP
	tristate "Loopback device support"
	---help---
	  Saying Y here will allow you to use a regular file as a block
	  device; you can then create a file system on that block device and
	  mount it just as you would mount other block devices such as hard
	  drive partitions, CD-ROM drives or floppy drives. The loop devices
	  are block special device files with major number 7 and typically
	  called /dev/loop0, /dev/loop1 etc.

	  This is useful if you want to check an ISO 9660 file system before
	  burning the CD, or if you want to use floppy images without first
	  writing them to floppy. Furthermore, some Linux distributions avoid
	  the need for a dedicated Linux partition by keeping their complete
	  root file system inside a DOS FAT file using this loop device
	  driver.

	  To use the loop device, you need the losetup utility, found in the
	  util-linux package, see
	  <ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/>.

	  The loop device driver can also be used to "hide" a file system in
	  a disk partition, floppy, or regular file, either using encryption
	  (scrambling the data) or steganography (hiding the data in the low
	  bits of, say, a sound file). This is also safe if the file resides
	  on a remote file server.

	  There are several ways of encrypting disks. Some of these require
	  kernel patches. The vanilla kernel offers the cryptoloop option
	  and a Device Mapper target (which is superior, as it supports all
	  file systems). If you want to use the cryptoloop, say Y to both
	  LOOP and CRYPTOLOOP, and make sure you have a recent (version 2.12
	  or later) version of util-linux. Additionally, be aware that
	  the cryptoloop is not safe for storing journaled filesystems.

	  Note that this loop device has nothing to do with the loopback
	  device used for network connections from the machine to itself.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

	  client and server works over TCP/IP networking, but to the client
	  program this is hidden: it looks like a regular local file access to
	  a block device special file such as /dev/nd0.

	  Network block devices also allows you to run a block-device in
	  userland (making server and client physically the same computer,
	  communicating using the loopback network device).

	  Read <file:Documentation/nbd.txt> for more information, especially

	  If you say Y here, your kernel will be able to manage low cost mass
	  storage units such as ATA/(E)IDE and ATAPI units. The most common
	  cases are IDE hard drives and ATAPI CD-ROM drives.

	  If your system is pure SCSI and doesn't use these interfaces, you
	  can say N here.

	  Integrated Disk Electronics (IDE aka ATA-1) is a connecting standard
	  for mass storage units such as hard disks. It was designed by
	  Western Digital and Compaq Computer in 1984. It was then named
	  ST506. Quite a number of disks use the IDE interface.

	  AT Attachment (ATA) is the superset of the IDE specifications.
	  ST506 was also called ATA-1.

	  Fast-IDE is ATA-2 (also named Fast ATA), Enhanced IDE (EIDE) is
	  ATA-3. It provides support for larger disks (up to 8.4GB by means of
	  the LBA standard), more disks (4 instead of 2) and for other mass
	  storage units such as tapes and cdrom. UDMA/33 (aka UltraDMA/33) is
	  ATA-4 and provides faster (and more CPU friendly) transfer modes
	  than previous PIO (Programmed processor Input/Output) from previous
	  ATA/IDE standards by means of fast DMA controllers.

	  ATA Packet Interface (ATAPI) is a protocol used by EIDE tape and
	  CD-ROM drives, similar in many respects to the SCSI protocol.

	  SMART IDE (Self Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) was
	  designed in order to prevent data corruption and disk crash by
	  detecting pre hardware failure conditions (heat, access time, and
	  the like...). Disks built since June 1995 may follow this standard.
	  The kernel itself doesn't manage this; however there are quite a
	  number of user programs such as smart that can query the status of
	  SMART parameters from disk drives.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

	  This will provide SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices,
	  and will allow you to use a SCSI device driver instead of a native
	  ATAPI driver.

	  This is useful if you have an ATAPI device for which no native
	  driver has been written (for example, an ATAPI PD-CD drive);
	  you can then use this emulation together with an appropriate SCSI

	  There are two drivers for MFM/RLL/IDE hard disks. Most people use
	  the newer enhanced driver, but this old one is still around for two
	  reasons. Some older systems have strange timing problems and seem to
	  work only with the old driver (which itself does not work with some
	  newer systems). The other reason is that the old driver is smaller,
	  since it lacks the enhanced functionality of the new one. This makes
	  it a good choice for systems with very tight memory restrictions, or
	  for systems with only older MFM/RLL/ESDI drives. Choosing the old
	  driver can save 13 KB or so of kernel memory.

	  If you are unsure, then just choose the Enhanced IDE/MFM/RLL driver
	  instead of this one. For more detailed information, read the

	  This turns on a logging facility that can be used to debug a number

	  "Sysctl support" below and executing the command

	  echo "scsi log token [level]" > /proc/scsi/scsi

	  at boot time after the /proc file system has been mounted.

	  There are a number of things that can be used for 'token' (you can
	  find them in the source: <file:drivers/scsi/scsi.c>), and this
	  allows you to select the types of information you want, and the
	  level allows you to select the level of verbosity.

	  If you say N here, it may be harder to track down some types of SCSI

	help
	  WARNING This driver is an older aic7xxx driver and is no longer
	  under active development.  Adaptec, Inc. is writing a new driver to
	  take the place of this one, and it is recommended that whenever
	  possible, people should use the new Adaptec written driver instead
	  of this one.  This driver will eventually be phased out entirely.

	  This is support for the various aic7xxx based Adaptec SCSI
	  controllers. These include the 274x EISA cards; 284x VLB cards;
	  2902, 2910, 293x, 294x, 394x, 3985 and several other PCI and
	  motherboard based SCSI controllers from Adaptec. It does not support
	  the AAA-13x RAID controllers from Adaptec, nor will it likely ever
	  support them. It does not support the 2920 cards from Adaptec that
	  use the Future Domain SCSI controller chip. For those cards, you
	  need the "Future Domain 16xx SCSI support" driver.

	  In general, if the controller is based on an Adaptec SCSI controller
	  chip from the aic777x series or the aic78xx series, this driver
	  should work. The only exception is the 7810 which is specifically
	  not supported (that's the RAID controller chip on the AAA-13x
	  cards).

	  Note that the AHA2920 SCSI host adapter is *not* supported by this
	  driver; choose "Future Domain 16xx SCSI support" instead if you have
	  one of those.

	  Information on the configuration options for this controller can be
	  found by checking the help file for each of the available
	  configuration options. You should read
	  <file:Documentation/scsi/aic7xxx_old.txt> at a minimum before
	  contacting the maintainer with any questions.  The SCSI-HOWTO,
	  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, can also
	  be of great help.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called aic7xxx_old.

	int "Maximum number of TCQ commands per device"
	depends on SCSI_AIC79XX
	default "32"
	---help---
	Specify the number of commands you would like to allocate per SCSI
	device when Tagged Command Queueing (TCQ) is enabled on that device.

	This is an upper bound value for the number of tagged transactions
	to be used for any device.  The aic7xxx driver will automatically
	vary this number based on device behavior.  For devices with a
	fixed maximum, the driver will eventually lock to this maximum
	and display a console message indicating this value.

	Due to resource allocation issues in the Linux SCSI mid-layer, using
	a high number of commands per device may result in memory allocation
	failures when many devices are attached to the system.  For this reason,
	the default is set to 32.  Higher values may result in higher performance
	on some devices.  The upper bound is 253.  0 disables tagged queueing.

	Per device tag depth can be controlled via the kernel command line

	  If the adapter isn't found during boot (a common problem for models

	  model 95 with a LED-matrix-display can in addition activate some
	  activity info like under OS/2, but more informative, by setting

config IBMMCA_SCSI_ORDER_STANDARD
	bool "Standard SCSI-order"
	depends on SCSI_IBMMCA
	---help---
	  In the PC-world and in most modern SCSI-BIOS-setups, SCSI-hard disks
	  are assigned to the drive letters, starting with the lowest SCSI-id
	  (physical number -- pun) to be drive C:, as seen from DOS and
	  similar operating systems. When looking into papers describing the
	  ANSI-SCSI-standard, this assignment of drives appears to be wrong.
	  The SCSI-standard follows a hardware-hierarchy which says that id 7
	  has the highest priority and id 0 the lowest. Therefore, the host
	  adapters are still today everywhere placed as SCSI-id 7 by default.
	  In the SCSI-standard, the drive letters express the priority of the
	  disk. C: should be the hard disk, or a partition on it, with the
	  highest priority. This must therefore be the disk with the highest
	  SCSI-id (e.g. 6) and not the one with the lowest! IBM-BIOS kept the
	  original definition of the SCSI-standard as also industrial- and
	  process-control-machines, like VME-CPUs running under realtime-OSes
	  (e.g. LynxOS, OS9) do.

	  If you like to run Linux on your MCA-machine with the same
	  assignment of hard disks as seen from e.g. DOS or OS/2 on your
	  machine, which is in addition conformant to the SCSI-standard, you
	  must say Y here. This is also necessary for MCA-Linux users who want
	  to keep downward compatibility to older releases of the
	  IBM-MCA-SCSI-driver (older than driver-release 2.00 and older than
	  June 1997).

	  If you like to have the lowest SCSI-id assigned as drive C:, as
	  modern SCSI-BIOSes do, which does not conform to the standard, but
	  is widespread and common in the PC-world of today, you must say N
	  here. If unsure, say Y.

config IBMMCA_SCSI_DEV_RESET

	  However, some devices exist, like special-control-devices,
	  SCSI-CNC-machines, SCSI-printer or scanners of older type, that do
	  not reset when switched on. If you say Y here, each device connected
	  to your SCSI-bus will be issued a reset-command after it has been
	  probed, while the kernel is booting. This may cause problems with
	  more modern devices, like hard disks, which do not appreciate these
	  reset commands, and can cause your system to hang. So say Y only if
	  you know that one of your older devices needs it; N is the safe
	  answer.

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_DEFAULT_TAGS
	int "default tagged command queue depth"
	depends on SCSI_ZALON || SCSI_NCR_Q720
	default "8"
	---help---
	  "Tagged command queuing" is a feature of SCSI-2 which improves
	  performance: the host adapter can send several SCSI commands to a
	  device's queue even if previous commands haven't finished yet.
	  Because the device is intelligent, it can optimize its operations
	  (like head positioning) based on its own request queue. Some SCSI
	  devices don't implement this properly; if you want to disable this
	  feature, enter 0 or 1 here (it doesn't matter which).

	  The default value is 8 and should be supported by most hard disks.
	  This value can be overridden from the boot command line using the
	  'tags' option as follows (example):
	  'ncr53c8xx=tags:4/t2t3q16/t0u2q10' will set default queue depth to
	  4, set queue depth to 16 for target 2 and target 3 on controller 0
	  and set queue depth to 10 for target 0 / lun 2 on controller 1.

	  The normal answer therefore is to go with the default 8 and to use
	  a boot command line option for devices that need to use a different
	  command queue depth.

	  There is no safe option other than using good SCSI devices.

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_MAX_TAGS
	int "maximum number of queued commands"

	  This option allows you to specify the maximum number of commands
	  that can be queued to any device, when tagged command queuing is
	  possible. The default value is 32. Minimum is 2, maximum is 64.
	  Modern hard disks are able to support 64 tags and even more, but
	  do not seem to be faster when more than 32 tags are being used.

	  So, the normal answer here is to go with the default value 32 unless
	  you are using very large hard disks with large cache (>= 1 MB) that
	  are able to take advantage of more than 32 tagged commands.

	  There is no safe option and the default answer is recommended.

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_SYNC
	int "synchronous transfers frequency in MHz"
	depends on SCSI_ZALON || SCSI_NCR_Q720
	default "20"
	---help---
	  The SCSI Parallel Interface-2 Standard defines 5 classes of transfer
	  rates: FAST-5, FAST-10, FAST-20, FAST-40 and FAST-80.  The numbers
	  are respectively the maximum data transfer rates in mega-transfers
	  per second for each class.  For example, a FAST-20 Wide 16 device is
	  able to transfer data at 20 million 16 bit packets per second for a
	  total rate of 40 MB/s.

	  You may specify 0 if you want to only use asynchronous data
	  transfers. This is the safest and slowest option. Otherwise, specify
	  a value between 5 and 80, depending on the capability of your SCSI
	  controller.  The higher the number, the faster the data transfer.
	  Note that 80 should normally be ok since the driver decreases the
	  value automatically according to the controller's capabilities.

	  Your answer to this question is ignored for controllers with NVRAM,
	  since the driver will get this information from the user set-up.  It
	  also can be overridden using a boot setup option, as follows
	  (example): 'ncr53c8xx=sync:12' will allow the driver to negotiate
	  for FAST-20 synchronous data transfer (20 mega-transfers per
	  second).

	  The normal answer therefore is not to go with the default but to
	  select the maximum value 80 allowing the driver to use the maximum
	  value supported by each controller. If this causes problems with
	  your SCSI devices, you should come back and decrease the value.

	  There is no safe option other than using good cabling, right
	  terminations and SCSI conformant devices.

	  the sym53c416 is configured first using some sort of PnP
	  configuration program (e.g. isapnp) or by a PnP aware BIOS. If you
	  are using isapnp then you need to compile this driver as a module
	  and then load it using insmod after isapnp has run. The parameters
	  of the configured card(s) should be passed to the driver. The format
	  is:

	  insmod sym53c416 sym53c416=<base>,<irq> [sym53c416_1=<base>,<irq>]

config SCSI_U14_34F_TAGGED_QUEUE
	bool "enable tagged command queueing"

	  This option enables elevator sorting for all probed SCSI disks and
	  CD-ROMs. It definitely reduces the average seek distance when doing
	  random seeks, but this does not necessarily result in a noticeable
	  performance improvement: your mileage may vary...
	  This is equivalent to the "u14-34f=lc:y" boot option.

config SCSI_U14_34F_MAX_TAGS
	int "maximum number of queued commands"
	depends on SCSI_U14_34F

	help
	  This specifies how many SCSI commands can be maximally queued for
	  each probed SCSI device. You should reduce the default value of 8
	  only if you have disks with buggy or limited tagged command support.
	  Minimum is 2 and maximum is 14. This value is also the window size
	  used by the elevator sorting option above. The effective value used
	  by the driver for each probed SCSI device is reported at boot time.

config SCSI_DEBUG
	tristate "SCSI debugging host simulator"
	depends on SCSI
	help
	  This is a host adapter simulator that can simulate multiple hosts
	  each with multiple dummy SCSI devices (disks). It defaults to one
	  host adapter with one dummy SCSI disk. Each dummy disk uses kernel
	  RAM as storage (i.e. it is a ramdisk). To save space when multiple
	  dummy disks are simulated, they share the same kernel RAM for 
	  their storage. See <http://www.torque.net/sg/sdebug.html> for more
	  information. This driver is primarily of use to those testing the

	  On Power Macintoshes (and clones) where the MESH SCSI bus adaptor
	  drives a bus which is entirely internal to the machine (such as the
	  7500, 7600, 8500, etc.), the MESH is capable of synchronous
	  operation at up to 10 MB/s. On machines where the SCSI bus
	  controlled by the MESH can have external devices connected, it is
	  usually rated at 5 MB/s. 5 is a safe value here unless you know the
	  MESH SCSI bus is internal only; in that case you can say 10. Say 0
	  to disable synchronous operation.

config SCSI_MESH_RESET_DELAY_MS

	  This is a feature of SCSI-2 which improves performance: the host

	---help---
	  If you have a CD-ROM drive that is neither SCSI nor IDE/ATAPI, say Y
	  here, otherwise N. Read the CD-ROM-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about these CD-ROM drives. If you are unsure what you
	  have, say Y and find out whether you have one of the following
	  drives.

	  For each of these drivers, a <file:Documentation/cdrom/{driver_name}>
	  exists. Especially in cases where you do not know exactly which kind
	  of drive you have you should read there. Most of these drivers use a
	  file drivers/cdrom/{driver_name}.h where you can define your
	  interface parameters and switch some internal goodies.

	  To compile these CD-ROM drivers as a module, choose M instead of Y.

	  If you want to use any of these CD-ROM drivers, you also have to
	  answer Y or M to "ISO 9660 CD-ROM file system support" below (this
	  answer will get "defaulted" for you if you enable any of the Linux
	  CD-ROM drivers).

config AZTCD
	tristate "Aztech/Orchid/Okano/Wearnes/TXC/CyDROM  CDROM support"

	  This is your driver if you have an Aztech CDA268-01A, Orchid
	  CD-3110, Okano or Wearnes CDD110, Conrad TXC, or CyCD-ROM CR520 or
	  CR540 CD-ROM drive.  This driver -- just like all these CD-ROM
	  drivers -- is NOT for CD-ROM drives with IDE/ATAPI interfaces, such
	  as Aztech CDA269-031SE. Please read the file
	  <file:Documentation/cdrom/aztcd>.

	  If you say Y here, you should also say Y or M to "ISO 9660 CD-ROM
	  file system support" below, because that's the file system used on
	  CD-ROMs.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called aztcd.

config GSCD

	  in the file <file:drivers/cdrom/gscd.h> before compiling the
	  kernel.  Please read the file <file:Documentation/cdrom/gscd>.

	  If you say Y here, you should also say Y or M to "ISO 9660 CD-ROM

	  This driver supports most of the drives which use the Panasonic or
	  Sound Blaster interface.  Please read the file
	  <file:Documentation/cdrom/sbpcd>.

	  The Matsushita CR-521, CR-522, CR-523, CR-562, CR-563 drives
	  (sometimes labeled "Creative"), the Creative Labs CD200, the
	  Longshine LCS-7260, the "IBM External ISA CD-ROM" (in fact a CR-56x
	  model), the TEAC CD-55A fall under this category.  Some other
	  "electrically compatible" drives (Vertos, Genoa, some Funai models)
	  are currently not supported; for the Sanyo H94A drive currently a
	  separate driver (asked later) is responsible.  Most drives have a
	  uniquely shaped faceplate, with a caddyless motorized drawer, but
	  without external brand markings.  The older CR-52x drives have a
	  caddy and manual loading/eject, but still no external markings.  The
	  driver is able to do an extended auto-probing for interface
	  addresses and drive types; this can help to find facts in cases you
	  are not sure, but can consume some time during the boot process if
	  none of the supported drives gets found.  Once your drive got found,
	  you should enter the reported parameters into
	  <file:drivers/cdrom/sbpcd.h> and set "DISTRIBUTION 0" there.

	  This driver can support up to four CD-ROM controller cards, and each
	  card can support up to four CD-ROM drives; if you say Y here, you
	  will be asked how many controller cards you have.  If compiled as a

	---help---
	  This driver lets you combine several hard disk partitions into one
	  logical block device. This can be used to simply append one
	  partition to another one or to combine several redundant hard disks
	  into a RAID1/4/5 device so as to provide protection against hard
	  disk failures. This is called "Software RAID" since the combining of

	---help---
	  A RAID-5 set can be expanded by adding extra drives. This
	  requires "restriping" the array which means (almost) every
	  block must be written to a different place.

          This option allows such restriping to be done while the array
	  is online.

	  You will need mdadm version 2.4.1 or later to use this
	  feature safely.  During the early stage of reshape there is
	  a critical section where live data is being over-written.  A
	  crash during this time needs extra care for recovery.  The
	  newer mdadm takes a copy of the data in the critical section
	  and will restore it, if necessary, after a crash.

	  The mdadm usage is e.g.
	       mdadm --grow /dev/md1 --raid-disks=6
	  to grow '/dev/md1' to having 6 disks.

	  Note: The array can only be expanded, not contracted.

	  The Intelligent Input/Output (I2O) architecture allows hardware

	  HDM's are not OS dependent. This allows for the same HDM driver to
	  be used under different operating systems if the relevant OSM is in
	  place. In order for this to work, you need to have an I2O interface
	  adapter card in your computer. This card contains a special I/O

	  Ethernet (also called IEEE 802.3 or ISO 8802-2) is the most common

	  Common varieties of Ethernet are: 10BASE-2 or Thinnet (10 Mbps over
	  coaxial cable, linking computers in a chain), 10BASE-T or twisted
	  pair (10 Mbps over twisted pair cable, linking computers to central

	  100BASE-T4 (100 Mbps over 4 standard voice-grade twisted pair
	  cables, using hubs), 100BASE-FX (100 Mbps over optical fiber links)
	  [the 100BASE varieties are also known as Fast Ethernet], and Gigabit
	  Ethernet (1 Gbps over optical fiber or short copper links).

	  This driver supports several kinds of network links over USB,

	  The USB host runs "usbnet", and the other end of the link might be:

	  - Another USB host, when using USB "network" or "data transfer"
	    cables.  These are often used to network laptops to PCs, like
	    "Laplink" parallel cables or some motherboards.  These rely
	    on specialized chips from many suppliers.

	  - An intelligent USB gadget, perhaps embedding a Linux system.
	    These include PDAs running Linux (iPaq, Yopy, Zaurus, and
	    others), and devices that interoperate using the standard
	    CDC-Ethernet specification (including many cable modems).

	  - Network adapter hardware (like those for 10/100 Ethernet) which
	    uses this driver framework.

	  The link will appear with a name like "usb0", when the link is
	  a two-node link, or "eth0" for most CDC-Ethernet devices.  Those
	  two-node links are most easily managed with Ethernet Bridging
	  (CONFIG_BRIDGE) instead of routing.

	  The default settings for the burst sizes are suitable for most PCI
	  chipsets. However, in some cases, large bursts may overrun buffers
	  in the PCI chipset and cause data corruption. In such cases, large
	  bursts must be disabled and only (slower) small bursts can be used.
	  The burst sizes can be set independently in the send (TX) and
	  receive (RX) direction.

	  Note that enabling many different burst sizes in the same direction
	  may increase the cost of setting up a transfer such that the
	  resulting throughput is lower than when using only the largest
	  available burst size.

	  Also, sometimes larger bursts lead to lower throughput, e.g. on an

config PLIP

	---help---
	  PLIP (Parallel Line Internet Protocol) is used to create a

	  install a Linux distribution on a machine which doesn't have a
	  CD-ROM drive (a minimal system has to be transferred with floppies
	  first). The kernels on both machines need to have this PLIP option
	  enabled for this to work.

	  The PLIP driver has two modes, mode 0 and mode 1.  The parallel
	  ports (the connectors at the computers with 25 holes) are connected
	  with "null printer" or "Turbo Laplink" cables which can transmit 4
	  bits at a time (mode 0) or with special PLIP cables, to be used on
	  bidirectional parallel ports only, which can transmit 8 bits at a
	  time (mode 1); you can find the wiring of these cables in
	  <file:Documentation/networking/PLIP.txt>.  The cables can be up to
	  15m long.  Mode 0 works also if one of the machines runs DOS/Windows
	  and has some PLIP software installed, e.g. the Crynwr PLIP packet
	  driver (<http://oak.oakland.edu/simtel.net/msdos/pktdrvr-pre.html>)
	  and winsock or NCSA's telnet.

	  If you want to use PLIP, say Y and read the PLIP mini-HOWTO as well
	  as the NET-3-HOWTO, both available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Note that the PLIP

	  your kernel by about 8 KB.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read

config PPP
	tristate "PPP (point-to-point protocol) support"
	select SLHC
	---help---
	  PPP (Point to Point Protocol) is a newer and better SLIP.  It serves
	  the same purpose: sending Internet traffic over telephone (and other
	  serial) lines.  Ask your access provider if they support it, because
	  otherwise you can't use it; most Internet access providers these
	  days support PPP rather than SLIP.

	  To use PPP, you need an additional program called pppd as described
	  in the PPP-HOWTO, available at
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Make sure that you have
	  the version of pppd recommended in <file:Documentation/Changes>.
	  The PPP option enlarges your kernel by about 16 KB.

	  There are actually two versions of PPP: the traditional PPP for
	  asynchronous lines, such as regular analog phone lines, and
	  synchronous PPP which can be used over digital ISDN lines for
	  example.  If you want to use PPP over phone lines or other
	  asynchronous serial lines, you need to say Y (or M) here and also to
	  the next option, "PPP support for async serial ports".  For PPP over
	  synchronous lines, you should say Y (or M) here and to "Support
	  synchronous PPP", below.

	  If you said Y to "Version information on all symbols" above, then
	  you cannot compile the PPP driver into the kernel; you can then only
	  compile it as a module. To compile this driver as a module, choose M
	  here and read <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>.
	  The module will be called ppp_generic.

config PPP_MULTILINK

	  PPP multilink is a protocol (defined in RFC 1990) which allows you

config PPP_FILTER

	  Support for the Deflate compression method for PPP, which uses the
	  Deflate algorithm (the same algorithm that gzip uses) to compress
	  each PPP packet before it is sent over the wire.  The machine at the
	  other end of the PPP link (usually your ISP) has to support the
	  Deflate compression method as well for this to be useful.  Even if
	  they don't support it, it is safe to say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.

config PPP_BSDCOMP
	tristate "PPP BSD-Compress compression"
	depends on PPP
	---help---
	  Support for the BSD-Compress compression method for PPP, which uses

	  sent over the wire. The machine at the other end of the PPP link
	  (usually your ISP) has to support the BSD-Compress compression
	  method as well for this to be useful. Even if they don't support it,
	  it is safe to say Y here.

	  The PPP Deflate compression method ("PPP Deflate compression",
	  above) is preferable to BSD-Compress, because it compresses better
	  and is patent-free.

	  serial connections such as telephone lines or null modem cables;
	  nowadays, the protocol PPP is more commonly used for this same
	  purpose.

	  Normally, your access provider has to support SLIP in order for you
	  to be able to use it, but there is now a SLIP emulator called SLiRP
	  around (available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which

	  Internet connectivity if you have a regular dial up shell account on
	  some Internet connected Unix computer. Read

	  ISDN ("Integrated Services Digital Networks", called RNIS in France)
	  is a special type of fully digital telephone service; it's mostly
	  used to connect to your Internet service provider (with SLIP or
	  PPP).  The main advantage is that the speed is higher than ordinary
	  modem/telephone connections, and that you can have voice
	  conversations while downloading stuff.  It only works if your
	  computer is equipped with an ISDN card and both you and your service
	  provider purchased an ISDN line from the phone company.  For
	  details, read <http://www.alumni.caltech.edu/~dank/isdn/> on the WWW.

	  channel-bundling, callback and caller-authentication without having
	  a daemon running.  A reduced T.70 protocol is supported with tty's
	  suitable for German BTX.  On D-Channel, the protocols EDSS1
	  (Euro-ISDN) and 1TR6 (German style) are supported.  See
	  <file:Documentation/isdn/README> for more information.

	  ISDN support in the linux kernel is moving towards a new API,
	  called CAPI (Common ISDN Application Programming Interface).
	  Therefore the old ISDN4Linux layer will eventually become obsolete.
	  It is still available, though, for use with adapters that are not
	  supported by the new CAPI subsystem yet.

	  Over digital connections such as ISDN, there is no need to

	  "synchronous PPP". Saying Y here will include this protocol. This
	  protocol is used by Cisco and Sun for example. So you want to say Y
	  here if the other end of your ISDN connection supports it. You will

	  If you say Y here, you will get support for terminal devices with

	  one can be used for a text-mode user session, and a third could run
	  an X session, all in parallel. Switching between virtual terminals
	  is done with certain key combinations, usually Alt-<function key>.

	  The setterm command ("man setterm") can be used to change the
	  properties (such as colors or beeping) of a virtual terminal. The
	  man page console_codes(4) ("man console_codes") contains the special
	  character sequences that can be used to change those properties
	  directly. The fonts used on virtual terminals can be changed with
	  the setfont ("man setfont") command and the key bindings are defined
	  with the loadkeys ("man loadkeys") command.

	  You need at least one virtual terminal device in order to make use
	  of your keyboard and monitor. Therefore, only people configuring an
	  embedded system would want to say N here in order to save some

	default y
	---help---
	  A pseudo terminal (PTY) is a software device consisting of two
	  halves: a master and a slave. The slave device behaves identical to
	  a physical terminal; the master device is used by a process to
	  read data from and write data to the slave, thereby emulating a
	  terminal. Typical programs for the master side are telnet servers
	  and xterms.

	  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for
	  masters and /dev/ttyxx for slaves of pseudo terminals. This scheme
	  has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later,
	  however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a
	  pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo
	  terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo
	  terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was
	  traditionally /dev/ttyp2 will then be /dev/pts/2, for example.

	  Also read the Printing-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/parport.txt>.  The module will be called lp.

	  If you have several parallel ports, you can specify which ports to
	  use with the "lp" kernel command line option.  (Try "man bootparam"
	  or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about
	  how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)  The syntax of the

	  This is the parallel port equivalent of SCSI generic support (sg).
	  It is safe to say N to this -- it is not needed for normal printing

	  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/nvram

	  you get read and write access to the extra bytes of non-volatile
	  memory in the real time clock (RTC), which is contained in every PC
	  and most Ataris.  The actual number of bytes varies, depending on the
	  nvram in the system, but is usually 114 (128-14 for the RTC).

	  This memory is conventionally called "CMOS RAM" on PCs and "NVRAM"
	  on Ataris. /dev/nvram may be used to view settings there, or to
	  change them (with some utility). It could also be used to frequently
	  save a few bits of very important data that may not be lost over
	  power-off and for which writing to disk is too insecure. Note
	  however that most NVRAM space in a PC belongs to the BIOS and you
	  should NEVER idly tamper with it. See Ralf Brown's interrupt list
	  for a guide to the use of CMOS bytes by your BIOS.

	  AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) is a bus system mainly used to
	  connect graphics cards to the rest of the system.

	  If you have an AGP system and you say Y here, it will be possible to
	  use the AGP features of your 3D rendering video card. This code acts
	  as a sort of "AGP driver" for the motherboard's chipset.

	  If you need more texture memory than you can get with the AGP GART
	  (theoretically up to 256 MB, but in practice usually 64 or 128 MB
	  due to kernel allocation issues), you could use PCI accesses
	  and have up to a couple gigs of texture space.

	  Note that this is the only means to have X/GLX use
	  write-combining with MTRR support on the AGP bus. Without it, OpenGL
	  direct rendering will be a lot slower but still faster than PIO.

	  The "Serial Peripheral Interface" is a low level synchronous

config FB
	tristate "Support for frame buffer devices"
	---help---
	  The frame buffer device provides an abstraction for the graphics
	  hardware. It represents the frame buffer of some video hardware and
	  allows application software to access the graphics hardware through
	  a well-defined interface, so the software doesn't need to know
	  anything about the low-level (hardware register) stuff.

	  Frame buffer devices work identically across the different
	  architectures supported by Linux and make the implementation of
	  application programs easier and more portable; at this point, an X
	  server exists which uses the frame buffer device exclusively.
	  On several non-X86 architectures, the frame buffer device is the
	  only way to use the graphics hardware.

	  The device is accessed through special device nodes, usually located
	  in the /dev directory, i.e. /dev/fb*.

	  You need an utility program called fbset to make full use of frame
	  buffer devices. Please read <file:Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt>
	  and the Framebuffer-HOWTO at
	  <http://www.tahallah.demon.co.uk/programming/prog.html> for more
	  information.

	  Say Y here and to the driver for your graphics board below if you
	  are compiling a kernel for a non-x86 architecture.

	  If you are compiling for the x86 architecture, you can say Y if you
	  want to play with it, but it is not essential. Please note that
	  running graphical applications that directly touch the hardware
	  (e.g. an accelerated X server) and that are not frame buffer
	  device-aware may cause unexpected results. If unsure, say N.

         This enables tile blitting.  Tile blitting is a drawing technique
	 where the screen is divided into rectangular sections (tiles), whereas
	 the standard blitting divides the screen into pixels. Because the
	 default drawing element is a tile, drawing functions will be passed
	 parameters in terms of number of tiles instead of number of pixels.
	 For example, to draw a single character, instead of using bitmaps,
	 an index to an array of bitmaps will be used.  To clear or move a
	 rectangular section of a screen, the rectangle will be described in
	 terms of number of tiles in the x- and y-axis.

	 This is particularly important to one driver, matroxfb.  If
	 unsure, say N.

	  If you have a sound card in your computer, i.e. if it can say more
	  than an occasional beep, say Y.  Be sure to have all the information
	  about your sound card and its configuration down (I/O port,
	  interrupt and DMA channel), because you will be asked for it.

	  You want to read the Sound-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. General information about
	  the modular sound system is contained in the files
	  <file:Documentation/sound/oss/Introduction>.  The file
	  <file:Documentation/sound/oss/README.OSS> contains some slightly
	  outdated but still useful information as well.  Newer sound
	  driver documentation is found in <file:Documentation/sound/alsa/*>.

	  If you have a PnP sound card and you want to configure it at boot
	  time using the ISA PnP tools (read
	  <http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools/>), then you need to
	  compile the sound card support as a module and load that module
	  after the PnP configuration is finished.  To do this, choose M here
	  and read <file:Documentation/sound/oss/README.modules>; the module
	  will be called soundcore.

	  I'm told that even without a sound card, you can make your computer
	  say more than an occasional beep, by programming the PC speaker.
	  Kernel patches and supporting utilities to do that are in the pcsp
	  package, available at <ftp://ftp.infradead.org/pub/pcsp/>.

	  made by Microsoft or Aztech SG 16 Pro (or NX16 Pro).  Also you may
	  say Y in case your card is NOT among these:

	  ATI Stereo F/X, AdLib, Audio Excell DSP16, Cardinal DSP16,
	  Ensoniq SoundScape (and compatibles made by Reveal and Spea),
	  Gravis Ultrasound, Gravis Ultrasound ACE, Gravis Ultrasound Max,
	  Gravis Ultrasound with 16 bit option, Logitech Sound Man 16,
	  Logitech SoundMan Games, Logitech SoundMan Wave, MAD16 Pro (OPTi
	  82C929), Media Vision Jazz16, MediaTriX AudioTriX Pro, Microsoft
	  Windows Sound System (MSS/WSS), Mozart (OAK OTI-601), Orchid
	  SW32, Personal Sound System (PSS), Pro Audio Spectrum 16, Pro

	  notebook, ThunderBoard, Turtle Beach Tropez, Yamaha FM
	  synthesizers (OPL2, OPL3 and OPL4), 6850 UART MIDI Interface.

	  For cards having native support in VoxWare, consult the card
	  specific instructions in <file:Documentation/sound/oss/README.OSS>.
	  Some drivers have their own MSS support and saying Y to this option
	  will cause a conflict.

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
	  "ad1848=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>[,<type>]" to the kernel command
	  line.

config SOUND_MPU401
	tristate "MPU-401 support (NOT for SB16)"
	depends on SOUND_OSS
	---help---
	  Be careful with this question.  The MPU401 interface is supported by
	  all sound cards.  However, some natively supported cards have their
	  own driver for MPU401.  Enabling this MPU401 option with these cards
	  will cause a conflict.  Also, enabling MPU401 on a system that
	  doesn't really have a MPU401 could cause some trouble.  If your card
	  was in the list of supported cards, look at the card specific
	  instructions in the <file:Documentation/sound/oss/README.OSS> file.  It
	  is safe to answer Y if you have a true MPU401 MIDI interface card.

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
	  "mpu401=<io>,<irq>" to the kernel command line.

config SOUND_PAS

	  Answer Y only if you have a Pro Audio Spectrum 16, ProAudio Studio
	  16 or Logitech SoundMan 16 sound card. Answer N if you have some
	  other card made by Media Vision or Logitech since those are not
	  PAS16 compatible. Please read <file:Documentation/sound/oss/PAS16>.
	  It is not necessary to add Sound Blaster support separately; it
	  is included in PAS support.

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
	  "pas2=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>,<sbio>,<sbirq>,<sbdma>,<sbdma2>
	  to the kernel command line.

	  Answer Y if your card has a FM chip made by Yamaha (OPL2/OPL3/OPL4).
	  Answering Y is usually a safe and recommended choice, however some
	  cards may have software (TSR) FM emulation. Enabling FM support with
	  these cards may cause trouble (I don't currently know of any such
	  cards, however). Please read the file
	  <file:Documentation/sound/oss/OPL3> if your card has an OPL3 chip.

	  Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a specification for a serial bus
	  subsystem which offers higher speeds and more features than the
	  traditional PC serial port.  The bus supplies power to peripherals
	  and allows for hot swapping.  Up to 127 USB peripherals can be
	  connected to a single USB host in a tree structure.
	  
	  The USB host is the root of the tree, the peripherals are the
	  leaves and the inner nodes are special USB devices called hubs.
	  Most PCs now have USB host ports, used to connect peripherals
	  such as scanners, keyboards, mice, modems, cameras, disks,
	  flash memory, network links, and printers to the PC.

	  Say Y here if your computer has a host-side USB port and you want
	  to use USB devices.  You then need to say Y to at least one of the
	  Host Controller Driver (HCD) options below.  Choose a USB 1.1

	  and "EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support" except for older systems that
	  do not have USB 2.0 support.  It doesn't normally hurt to select

	  "/proc/bus/usb/xxx/yyy", where xxx is the bus number and yyy the
	  device number; the latter files can be used by user space programs
	  to talk directly to the device. These files are "virtual", meaning
	  they are generated on the fly and not stored on the hard drive.

	  You may need to mount the usbfs file system to see the files, use
	  mount -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb

	  For the format of the various /proc/bus/usb/ files, please read
	  <file:Documentation/usb/proc_usb_info.txt>.

	  Usbfs files can't handle Access Control Lists (ACL), which are the
	  default way to grant access to USB devices for untrusted users of a
	  desktop system. The usbfs functionality is replaced by real

config USB_DEVICE_CLASS

	---help---
	  Userspace access to USB devices is granted by device-nodes exported

	  core and udev needed additional class devices to export device nodes.

	  These additional devices are difficult to handle in userspace, if
	  information about USB interfaces must be available. One device
	  contains the device node, the other device contains the interface
	  data. Both devices are at the same level in sysfs (siblings) and one
	  can't access the other. The device node created directly by the
	  usb device is the parent device of the interface and therefore
	  easily accessible from the interface event.

	  This option provides backward compatibility for libusb device

	  The Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI) is standard for USB 2.0
	  "high speed" (480 Mbit/sec, 60 Mbyte/sec) host controller hardware.
	  If your USB host controller supports USB 2.0, you will likely want to
	  configure this Host Controller Driver.  At the time of this writing, 
	  the primary implementation of EHCI is a chip from NEC, widely available
	  in add-on PCI cards, but implementations are in the works from other 
	  vendors including Intel and Philips.  Motherboard support is appearing.

	  EHCI controllers are packaged with "companion" host controllers (OHCI
	  or UHCI) to handle USB 1.1 devices connected to root hub ports.  Ports
	  will connect to EHCI if the device is high speed, otherwise they
	  connect to a companion controller.  If you configure EHCI, you should
	  probably configure the OHCI (for NEC and some other vendors) USB Host
	  Controller Driver or UHCI (for Via motherboards) Host Controller
	  Driver too.

	  You may want to read <file:Documentation/usb/ehci.txt>.

	  transaction translators, so that no OHCI or UHCI companion
	  controller is needed.  It's safe to say "y" even if your

	  USB-to-PCMCIA adapter, and this "u132-hcd" module is a USB host
	  controller driver that talks to the OHCI controller within the
	  CardBus cards that are inserted in the U132 adapter.

	   USB is a master/slave protocol, organized with one master
	   host (such as a PC) controlling up to 127 peripheral devices.
	   The USB hardware is asymmetric, which makes it easier to set up:
	   you can't connect a "to-the-host" connector to a peripheral.

	   Linux can run in the host, or in the peripheral.  In both cases
	   you need a low level bus controller driver, and some software
	   talking to it.  Peripheral controllers are often discrete silicon,
	   or are integrated with the CPU in a microcontroller.  The more
	   familiar host side controllers have names like "EHCI", "OHCI",
	   or "UHCI", and are usually integrated into southbridges on PC
	   motherboards.

	   Enable this configuration option if you want to run Linux inside
	   a USB peripheral device.  Configure one hardware driver for your
	   peripheral/device side bus controller, and a "gadget driver" for
	   your peripheral protocol.  (If you use modular gadget drivers,
	   you may configure more than one.)

	   If in doubt, say "N" and don't enable these drivers; most people

	  A Linux "Gadget Driver" talks to the USB Peripheral Controller

	  A gadget driver implements one or more USB functions using
	  the peripheral hardware.

	  Gadget drivers are hardware-neutral, or "platform independent",
	  except that they sometimes must understand quirks or limitations
	  of the particular controllers they work with.  For example, when
	  a controller doesn't support alternate configurations or provide

	  Gadget Zero also works with the host-side "usb-skeleton" driver,

	  driver, so that deep I/O queues can be supported.  On 2.4 kernels,

	  If you want to use one of the FAT-based file systems (the MS-DOS and
	  VFAT (Windows 95) file systems), then you must say Y or M here
	  to include FAT support. You will then be able to mount partitions or
	  diskettes with FAT-based file systems and transparently access the
	  files on them, i.e. MSDOS files will look and behave just like all
	  other Unix files.

	  This FAT support is not a file system in itself, it only provides
	  the foundation for the other file systems. You will have to say Y or
	  M to at least one of "MSDOS fs support" or "VFAT fs support" in
	  order to make use of it.

	  Another way to read and write MSDOS floppies and hard drive
	  partitions from within Linux (but not transparently) is with the
	  mtools ("man mtools") program suite. You don't need to say Y here in
	  order to do that.

	  If you need to move large files on floppies between a DOS and a
	  Linux box, say Y here, mount the floppy under Linux with an MSDOS
	  file system and use GNU tar's M option. GNU tar is a program
	  available for Unix and DOS ("man tar" or "info tar").

	  The FAT support will enlarge your kernel by about 37 KB. If unsure,
	  say Y.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called
	  fat.  Note that if you compile the FAT support as a module, you

	  This option will enlarge your kernel by about 7 KB. If unsure,

	  the Linux 2.4 kernel series is separately available as a patch
	  from the project web site.

	  For more information see <file:Documentation/filesystems/ntfs.txt>

	  disabled by default.  To enable them, supply the option debug_msgs=1
	  at the kernel command line when booting the kernel or as an option
	  to insmod when loading the ntfs module.  Once the driver is active,
	  you can enable debugging messages by doing (as root):
	  echo 1 > /proc/sys/fs/ntfs-debug
	  Replacing the "1" with "0" would disable debug messages.

	  If you leave debugging messages disabled, this results in little
	  overhead, but enabling debug messages results in very significant
	  slowdown of the system.

	  When reporting bugs, please try to have available a full dump of
	  debugging messages while the misbehaviour was occurring.

config NTFS_RW
	bool "NTFS write support"
	depends on NTFS_FS
	help
	  This enables the partial, but safe, write support in the NTFS driver.

	  The only supported operation is overwriting existing files, without
	  changing the file length.  No file or directory creation, deletion or
	  renaming is possible.  Note only non-resident files can be written to
	  so you may find that some very small files (<500 bytes or so) cannot
	  be written to.

	  While we cannot guarantee that it will not damage any data, we have
	  so far not received a single report where the driver would have
	  damaged someones data so we assume it is perfectly safe to use.

	  Note:  While write support is safe in this version (a rewrite from
	  scratch of the NTFS support), it should be noted that the old NTFS
	  write support, included in Linux 2.5.10 and before (since 1997),
	  is not safe.

	  This is currently useful with TopologiLinux.  TopologiLinux is run
	  on top of any DOS/Microsoft Windows system without partitioning your
	  hard disk.  Unlike other Linux distributions TopologiLinux does not
	  need its own partition.  For more information see

	  It uses zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories.
	  Inodes in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise
	  data overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of 64K.
	  SquashFS 3.1 supports 64 bit filesystems and files (larger than 4GB), full
	  uid/gid information, hard links and timestamps.

	  Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
	  use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in embedded
	  systems where low overhead is needed.  Further information and filesystem tools
	  are available from http://squashfs.sourceforge.net.

	  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),

	  Unless your program is designed to use O_DIRECT properly, you are
	  much better off allowing the NFS client to manage data caching for

	  NCP (NetWare Core Protocol) is a protocol that runs over IPX and is
	  used by Novell NetWare clients to talk to file servers.  It is to
	  IPX what NFS is to TCP/IP, if that helps.  Saying Y here allows you
	  to mount NetWare file server volumes and to access them just like
	  any other Unix directory.  For details, please read the file
	  <file:Documentation/filesystems/ncpfs.txt> in the kernel source and
	  the IPX-HOWTO from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  You do not have to say Y here if you want your Linux box to act as a

config NCPFS_NFS_NS
	bool "Use NFS namespace if available"

	  If you say Y here, every filename on a NetWare server volume using
	  the OS2/LONG namespace and created under DOS or on a volume using
	  DOS namespace will be converted to lowercase characters.
	  Saying N here will give you these filenames in uppercase.

	  This is only a cosmetic option since the OS2/LONG namespace is case
	  insensitive. The only major reason for this option is backward
	  compatibility when moving from DOS to OS2/LONG namespace support.
	  Long filenames (created by Win95) will not be affected.

	  This option does not solve the problem that filenames appear
	  differently under Linux and under Windows, since Windows does an
	  additional conversions on the client side. You can achieve similar
	  effects by saying Y to "Allow using of Native Language Support"

	  Coda is an advanced network file system, similar to NFS in that it
	  enables you to mount file systems of a remote server and access them
	  with regular Unix commands as if they were sitting on your hard
	  disk.  Coda has several advantages over NFS: support for
	  disconnected operation (e.g. for laptops), read/write server
	  replication, security model for authentication and encryption,
	  persistent client caches and write back caching.

	  If you say Y here, your Linux box will be able to act as a Coda
	  *client*.  You will need user level code as well, both for the
	  client and server.  Servers are currently user level, i.e. they need
	  no kernel support.  Please read
	  <file:Documentation/filesystems/coda.txt> and check out the Coda

	default n
	help
	 This feature enables the kernel to prove that all locking
	 that occurs in the kernel runtime is mathematically
	 correct: that under no circumstance could an arbitrary (and
	 not yet triggered) combination of observed locking
	 sequences (on an arbitrary number of CPUs, running an
	 arbitrary number of tasks and interrupt contexts) cause a
	 deadlock.

	 In short, this feature enables the kernel to report locking
	 related deadlocks before they actually occur.

	 The proof does not depend on how hard and complex a
	 deadlock scenario would be to trigger: how many
	 participant CPUs, tasks and irq-contexts would be needed
	 for it to trigger. The proof also does not depend on
	 timing: if a race and a resulting deadlock is possible
	 theoretically (no matter how unlikely the race scenario
	 is), it will be proven so and will immediately be
	 reported by the kernel (once the event is observed that
	 makes the deadlock theoretically possible).

	 If a deadlock is impossible (i.e. the locking rules, as
	 observed by the kernel, are mathematically correct), the
	 kernel reports nothing.

	 NOTE: this feature can also be enabled for rwlocks, mutexes
	 and rwsems - in which case all dependencies between these
	 different locking variants are observed and mapped too, and
	 the proof of observed correctness is also maintained for an
	 arbitrary combination of these separate locking variants.

	  This option enables writing to a selinuxfs node 'disable', which
	  allows SELinux to be disabled at runtime prior to the policy load.
	  SELinux will then remain disabled until the next boot.
	  This option is similar to the selinux=0 boot parameter, but is to

	  that determines whether SELinux checks the protection requested
	  by the application or the protection that will be applied by the
	  kernel (including any implied execute for read-implies-exec) for
	  mmap and mprotect calls.  If this option is set to 0 (zero),
	  SELinux will default to checking the protection that will be applied
	  by the kernel.  If this option is set to 1 (one), SELinux will
	  default to checking the protection requested by the application.
	  The checkreqprot flag may be changed from the default via the
	  'checkreqprot=' boot parameter.  It may also be changed at runtime
	  via /selinux/checkreqprot if authorized by policy.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer 1.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_ENABLE_SECMARK_DEFAULT
	bool "NSA SELinux enable new secmark network controls by default"

	  This option determines whether the new secmark-based network
	  controls will be enabled by default.  If not, the old internal
	  per-packet controls will be enabled by default, preserving
	  old behavior.

	  If you enable the new controls, you will need updated
	  SELinux userspace libraries, tools and policy.  Typically,
	  your distribution will provide these and enable the new controls
	  in the kernel they also distribute.

	  Note that this option can be overridden at boot with the
	  selinux_compat_net parameter, and after boot via
	  /selinux/compat_net.  See Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
	  for details on this parameter.

	  If you enable the new network controls, you will likely
	  also require the SECMARK and CONNSECMARK targets, as
	  well as any conntrack helpers for protocols which you
	  wish to control.

	  If you are unsure what to do here, select N.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_POLICYDB_VERSION_MAX

	  This option enables the maximum policy format version supported
	  by SELinux to be set to a particular value.  This value is reported
	  to userspace via /selinux/policyvers and used at policy load time.
	  It can be adjusted downward to support legacy userland (init) that
	  does not correctly handle kernels that support newer policy versions.

	  Examples:
	  For the Fedora Core 3 or 4 Linux distributions, enable this option
	  and set the value via the next option. For Fedora Core 5 and later,
	  do not enable this option.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

	  Examples:
	  For Fedora Core 3, use 18.
	  For Fedora Core 4, use 19.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, look for the
