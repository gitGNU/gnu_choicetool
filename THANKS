	We would like to thanks the following peoples for their help:

Joe Orton:
        For his configure.ac/VERSION trick (as seen on his sitecopy) that
        we have adopted.

Autotools people:
	Some (all) Makefile.am ideas, targets, hints, tips, tricks ... about
	package configuration have been stolen from automake and autoconf
	packages ... so lot of thanks goes to all the autotools people.

glibc people:
	Some configure.ac code (plugins related) has been stolen from glibc
	configure.ac ... thanks
