Joe Orton:
	For his configure.ac/VERSION trick (as seen on his sitecopy) that
	we have adopted.

autotools people:
	Some (almost all) Makefile.am ideas, targets, hints, tips, tricks ...
        some package configuration and m4sh/m4sugar macros have been stolen
        from automake and autoconf packages ... so lot of thanks go to all the
        autotools people.

glibc people:
	Some configure.ac code (plugins related) has been stolen from glibc
	configure.ac ... thanks

Emanuele Bassi:
